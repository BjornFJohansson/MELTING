[INSTALLATION]

Unbundle the distribution in the proper place (e.g. /usr/local/ or c:\Program
Files) and the file melting-gui.desktop in /usr/share/applications. 

Some pre-compiled binaries are located in the directory BIN. The program just needs 
a Java 1.5 environment.

UNICES 

Type `sudo install.unice' to install the program.
The manpage melting.1 is moved in the proper location during the
installation. The other files can stay in doc or the entire doc directory can be
moved under the name melting in /usr/doc or an equivalent directory.

WINDOWS

The documentation is located in the directory doc. The files containing the nearest-neighbor
parameters are located in the directory Data. Move them in the proper
directory specified in c:/program files/melting/Data.

[EXECUTION]

READ THE DOCUMENTATION BEFORE TO RUN THE PROGRAM. 

The executable versions do not require any particular external libraries, 
and must run directly. Go to the directory containing the programme and 
type './melting [options]' under Unixes and 'melting.exe [options]' under 
DOS/Windows. 

You can also put the executable in a directory present in your PATH 
variable in order to use the programme wherever you are. The environment 
variable NN_PATH can be set to the directory containing your personal 
nearest-neighbor parameters. For instance in the bash:

export NN_PATH=$HOME/LIB/MELTING/NNFILES

In a graphical environment you can also launch melting by clicking on an 
icon linked to the program (the command-line options can then be entered 
through the properties of the icon, generally in the 'execute' or 'run' 
entry).

Type 'melting -h' to get a summary of options.

The directory testResults contains files with measured Tm from the literature.
They are useful only for testing the different sets of NN, the corrections
of salt concentration etc.
