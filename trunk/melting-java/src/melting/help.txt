	Mandatory options :
-S [sequence] : Nucleic acid sequence, mandatory. The sens of this sequence must be 5'-3'.
-C [complementary sequence] : Nucleic acid complementary sequence, mandatory only if there is inosine bases or azobenznes in 
                              the sequence entered with the opton -S. The sens of this sequence must be 3'-5''.
-E [agent1=concentration1:agent2=concentration2] : Different agent concentrations in the solution. The agents can be cations 
                                                   (Na, K, Tris, Mg for Na+, K+, Tris+ and Mg2+), dNTP or other agents (DMSO, 
                                                   formamide). The concentrations must be in Mol/L but there are some exceptions 
                                                   : DMSO is a percentage, formamide is a percentage if the method lincorr is 
                                                   chosen and in Mol/L if yhe method bla96 is chosen. At less one cation concentration 
                                                   is mandatory, the other agents are optional. See the documentation for the

-P [nucleotide concentration] : Concentration in mol/L of the nucleic acid strand in excess, mandatory.
-H [hybridization] : Type of hybridization, mandatory. Four types of hybridization are allowed : dnadna (DNA duplex), rnarna (RNA duplex),
                     dnarna or rnadna (hybrid DNA/RNA) and mrnarna or rnamrna (2-o-methyl RNA/ RNA). The type of hybridization defines the 
                     kind of the sequence and its complementary.
                     Ex : dnarna = the sequence (entered with the option -S) is a DNA sequence and its complementary (entered with the option 
                     -C) is a RNA sequence.
                     Ex : rnadna = the sequence (entered with the option -S) is a RNA sequence and its complementary (entered with the option 
                     -C) is a DNA sequence  

	General options :
