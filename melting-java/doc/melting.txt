                                    Synopsis

   The nearest-neighbor approach is based on the fact that the helix-coil
   transition works as a zipper. After an initial attachment, the
   hybridisation propagates laterally. The hybridization process depends
   on the adjacent nucleotides on each strand (the Crick's pairs). Two
   duplexes with the same base pairs could have different stabilities, and
   on the contrary, two duplexes with different sequences but identical
   sets of Crick's pairs will have the same thermodynamics properties (see
   Sugimoto et al. 1994). See Wetmur J.G (1991) and Santalucia (1998) for
   deep reviews on the nucleic acid hybridization and on the different set
   of nearest-neighbor parameters.

                                  Description

   MELTING computes, for a nucleic acid duplex, the enthalpy and the
   entropy of the helix-coil transition, and then its melting temperature.
   Four types of hybridisation are possible: DNA/DNA, DNA/RNA, RNA/RNA and
   2-O-Methyl RNA/RNA. The program uses the method of nearest-neighbors.
   The set of thermodynamic parameters can be easely changed, for instance
   following an experimental breakthrough. Melting is a free program in
   both sense of the term. It comes with no cost and it is open-source. In
   addition it is coded in Java (1.5) and can be compiled on any operating
   system.

     of nucleic acid duplex. Bioinformatics, 17: 1226-1227.

                                     Usage

   The options are treated sequentially. If there is a conflict between
   the value of two options, the latter normally erases the former.

Information about MELTING

   -h
          Displays a short help and quit.

   -L
          Prints the legal informations and quit.

   -V
          Displays the version number and quit.

   -p
          Return the directory supposed to contain the sets of
          calorimetric parameters and quit. If the environment variable
          NN_PATH is set, it is returned. Otherwise, the value defined by
          default during the compilation is returned.

Mandatory options

   -S sequence
          Sequence of one strand of the nucleic acid duplex, entered 5' to
          3'. Important: Uridine and thymidine are not considered as
          identical. The bases can be upper or lowercase.

   -C complementary_sequence
          Enters the complementary sequence, from 3' to 5'. This option is
          mandatory if there are mismatches, inosine(s) or
          hydroxyadenine(s) between the two strands. If it is not used,
          the program will compute it as the complement of the sequence
          entered with the option -S. In case of self complementary
          sequences, The program can automatically detect the symmetry and
          deduce the complementary even though there is (are) dangling
          end(s) and it is not necessary to write the complementary
          sequence with the option -C. Uridine and thymidine are not
          considered as identical. The bases can be upper or lowercase.

   -E ion1_name=x.xxe-xx:ion2_name=x.xxe-xx:agent1_name=x.xxe-xx...
          Enters the different ion (Na, Mg, Tris, K) or agent (dNTP, DMSO,
          formamide) concentrations. The effect of ions and denaturing
          agents on thermodynamic stability of nucleic acid duplexes is
          complex, and the correcting functions are at best rough
          approximations. All the concentrations must be positive numeric
          values and in M. There are some exceptions for the DMSO
          concentrations (in %) and the formamide concentrations (in % or
          M depending on the used correction method). Be aware, the $ [$
          Tris $ ^+]$ is about half of the total tris buffer
          concentration. At least one cation concentration is mandatory,
          the other agents are optional. See the documentation for the
          concentration limits. It depends on the used correction.

   -P x.xxe-xx
          Concentration of the nucleic acid strand in excess. It must be a
          strict positive numeric value and it is mandatory. The oligomer
          concentration is in mol/L.

   -H hybridisation_type
          Specifies the hybridisation type. Moreover this parameter
          determines the nature of the sequences entered by the user.
          Possible values are :

        dnadna
               : DNA sequence (option -S) and DNA complementary sequence
               (option -C)
        rnarna
               : RNA sequence (option -S) and RNA complementary sequence
               (option -C)
        dnarna
               : DNA sequence (option -S) and RNA complementary sequence
               (option -C)
        rnadna
               : RNA sequence (option -S) and DNA complementary sequence
               (option -C)
        mrnarna
               : 2-o-methyl RNA sequence (option -S) and RNA complementary
               sequence (option -C)
        mrnarna
               : RNA sequence (option -S) and 2-o-methyl RNA complementary
               sequence (option -C)

          This option is mandatory to select the default equations and
          methods to use.

General options

   -T xxx
          Size threshold before approximative computation. The
          nearest-neighbour approach will be used by default if the length
          of the sequence is inferior to this threshold, otherwise it is
          the approximative approach which will be used by default.

   -v
          Activates the verbose mode, issuing a lot more information about
          the current run (try it once to see if you can get something
          interesting).

   -nnpath folder_pathway
          Change the default pathway (Data) where to find the default
          calorimetric tables (thermodynamic parameters). The program will
          look for the file in a directory specified during the
          installation. However, if an environment variable NN_PATH is
          defined, melting will search in this one first.

   -O output_file
          The output is directed to this file instead of the standard
          output. The name of the file must be specified.

   -self
          To precise that the sequence entered with the option -S is self
          complementary. No complementary sequence is mandatory. The
          program automatically can detect a self complementary sequence
          for perfect matching sequences or sequences with dangling ends.
          In these cases, the option -self is not necessary. Otherwise we
          need to precise that the sequences are self complementary with
          this option. examples:

  Situation 1 : The sequence ATCGCGAT is self
                complementary.

          The option -self is not necessary because the program can
          automatically detect it.

  Situation 2 : The sequence -TCGCGAT is self
                complementary with a single
                dangling end.

          The option -self is not necessary because the program can
          automatically detect it.


  Situation 3 :  If the sequence ATCCCGAT is self
                 complementary with a single mismatch
                (C/C)

          The option -self is necessary to precise the self
          complementarity because the program can't detect it.

   -F factor
          This is the correction factor used to modulate the effect of the
          nucleic acid concentration in the computation of the melting
          temperature. See section ALGORITHM for details. If the sequences
          are automatically recognized as self complementary sequences or
          if the option -self is used, the factor correction is
          automatically 1. Otherwise F is 4 if the both strands are
          present in equivalent amount and 2 if one strand is in excess.
          The default factor value is 4.

Set of thermodynamic parameters and methods (models)

   By default, the approximative mode is used for oligonucleotides longer
   than 60 bases (the default threshold value), otherwise the nearest
   neighbor model is used.

   -am method_name
          Forces to use a specific approximative formula, based on G+C
          content. You can use one of the following :

          DNA DUPLEXES

        ahs01
               (from Ahsen et al. 2001)

               (from Owen et al. 1969)
        san98
               (from Santalucia et al. 1998)
        wetdna91
               (from Wetmur 1991) (by default)

          RNA DUPLEXES

        wetrna91

          DNA/RNA DUPLEXES

        wetdnarna91
               (from Wetmur 1991) (by default)

          If there is no formula name after the option -am, we will
          compute the melting temperature with the default approximative
          formula. This option has to be used with caution. Note that such
          a calcul is increasingly incorrect when the length of the duplex
          decreases. Moreover, it does not take into account nucleic acid
          concentration, which is a strong mistake. examples :

   command line 1 : "-am"

          if you want to force the approximative approach with the default
          formula.

   command line 2 : "-am ahs01"

          if you want to use the approximative formula from Ahsen et al.

          If there is no formula name after the option -nn, we will
          compute the melting temperature with the default nearest
          neighbor model. Each nearest neighbor model uses a specific xml
          file containing the thermodynamic values. If you want to use
          another file, write the file name or the file pathway preceded
          by ':' (-nn [optionalname:optionalfile]). examples:

  Command line 1 : "-nn"

          if you want to force the nearest neighbor computation with the
          default model.

  Command line 2 : "-nn tan04"

          if you want to use the nearest neighbor model from Tanaka et al.
          2004 with the thermodynamic parameters in the default xml file.

          Crick's pairs have been investigated.

   -intLP method_name

          The effect of ions on thermodynamic stability of nucleic acid
          duplexes is complex, and the correcting functions are at best
          rough approximations. By default, the program use the algorithm
          from Owczarzy et al 2008 : ratio = $ [$ Mg $ ^{0.5}]$ and
          monovalent = Na + Tris + K

          if monovalent = 0, a magnesium correction is used.

          if ratio < 0.22, a sodium correction is used.

          if 0.22 <= ratio < 6, a mixed Na Mg correction is used.

          if ratio >= 6, a magnesium correction is used.

          example :

  Command line : "-ion owcmg08"

          if you want to force the use of the magnesium correction from
          Owczarzy et al 2008. This correction will be used independently
          of the cations present in the solution.

   -naeq method_name
          Forces to use a specific ion correction which gives a sodium
          equivalent concentration if other cations are present. You can

          For the other types of hybridization, the DNA default correction
          is used but there is no guaranty of accuracy. If there are other
          cations when an approximative approach is used, a sodium
          equivalence is automatically computed. The correcting functions
          are at best rough approximations. example :

  Command line 1 : "-naeq ahs01"

          if you want to force the use of the sodium equivalence from
          Ahsen et al 2001. This sodium equivalence will be used in case
          of approximative approach. In case of nearest neighbor approach,
          the sodium equivalence will be used only if a sodium correction
          is selected by the user.

  Command line 2 : "-naeq ahs01 -ion san04"

          it means that the sodium equivalence computed by the method
          ahs01 (from Ahsen et al 2001) will be combined with the sodium
          correction san04 (from Santalucia 2004).

          For the other types of hybridization, the DNA default correction
          is used but there is no guaranty of accuracy. If there are DMSO
          when an approximative approach is used, a DMSO correction is
          automatically computed. The correcting functions are at best
          rough approximations. example :

  Command line : "-DMSO ahs01"

          if you want to force the use of the DMSO correction from Ahsen
          et al 2001. This DMSO correction will be used if there is DMSO
          present in the solutions in case of nearest neighbor approach
          and approximative approach.

   -for method_name
          Forces to use a specific formamide correction. You can use one
          of the following :

          DNA DUPLEXES

        bla96
               (from Blake et al 1996) with formamide concentration in
               mol/L (by default)
        lincorr
               (linear correction) with a % of formamide volume

          For the other types of hybridization, the DNA default correction
          is used but there is no guaranty of accuracy. If there are
          formamide when an approximative approach is used, a formamide
          correction is automatically computed. The correcting functions
          are at best rough approximations. example :

  Command line : "-for lincorr"

          if you want to force the use of the linear formamide correction.
          This formamide correction will be used if there is formamide
          present in the solutions in case of nearest neighbor approach
          and approximative approach.

                                   Algorithm

Thermodynamics of helix-coil transition of nucleic acid

   The nearest-neighbor approach is based on the fact that the helix-coil
   transition works as a zipper. After an initial attachment, the
   hybridisation propagates laterally. This program first computes the
   hybridisation enthalpy and entropy for each structure in the duplex.
   (see later for the different possible structures recognized by
   Melting). If the sequences are self complementary, a symmetry
   correction will be added to the initiation energy.

                    $\displaystyle \begin{array}[t]{ccc}
               \Delta{}H&=&\delta{}h_\mathrm{initiation}+\...
   ...S&=&\delta{}s_\mathrm{initiation}+\sum \delta{}s_\mathrm{structure}
                                \end{array}$

   Example :

   Sequence with a single mismatch

   ATCGGCTA
   TAGACGAT

                    $\displaystyle \begin{array}[t]{ccc}
               \Delta{}H&=&\delta{}h_\mathrm{initiation}+\...
   ...cture1}+\delta{}s_\mathrm{structure2}+\delta{}s_\mathrm{structure3}
                                \end{array}$

   where :

   structure1 = perfectly matching sequences ATC/TAG

   structure2 = single mismatch G/A

   structure 3 = perfectly matching sequences GCTA/CGAT

  Perfectly matching sequences

   The hybridization process depends on the adjacent nucleotides on each
   strand (the Crick's pairs). Two duplexes with the same base pairs could
   have different stabilities, and on the contrary, two duplexes with
   different sequences but identical sets of Crick's pairs will have the
   same thermodynamics properties. This program first computes the
   hybridisation enthalpy and entropy from the elementary parameters of
   each Crick's pair.

                    $\displaystyle \begin{array}[t]{ccc}
               \Delta{}h_\mathrm{perfectly-matching}&=&\su...
   ..._\mathrm{perfectly-matching}&=&\sum \delta{}s_\mathrm{Crick's pair}
                                \end{array}$

   The initiation computation is not the same for each following model.

  Sequences composed of CNG repeats

   If the sequence (sens 5'3') is a sequence of type G(CNG)xC where x is
   the number of CNG repeats in the sequence and N a unique nucleic acid
   which will get bound to itself, we can use specific experimental
   parameters to compute the enthalpy and entropy of the duplex formation.
   These parameters can be used only for sequences composed from 2 to 7
   CNG repeats and the initiation is already included.

   Be aware : The results for sequences composed of 4 or 5 CCG repeats is
   not reliable. (the figure shows two values far from the expected

   formation. See the article above for further informations.

  Single mismatch effect

   The single mismatches are taken into account but the two first and
   positions cannot be mismatched. in such a case, the result is
   unpredictable, and all cases are possible. for instance (see Allawi and
   SanLucia 1997), the duplex

   A          T
    GTGAGCTCAT
    TACTCGAGTG
   T          A

   is more stable than

   AGTGAGCTCATT
   TTACTCGAGTGA

   For DNA duplexes, this program computes the hybridisation enthalpy and
   entropy from the elementary parameters of each Crick's pair containing
   the single mismatch.

                    $\displaystyle \begin{array}[t]{ccc}
                  \Delta{}h_\mathrm{single-mismatch}&=&\sum
   \delta{}h_\mathrm{Crick's-pair-containing-the-mismatch}\\ \end{array}$

   Example :

           \begin{multline*} \Delta H {\mbox{\texttt{ATC}} \choose
    \mbox{\texttt{TCG}}} = ... ...+ \Delta H {\mbox{\texttt{TC}} \choose
                   \mbox{\texttt{CG}} } \\ \end{multline*}

   For RNA duplexes, the different models to computes the thermodynamic
   contribution of single mismatch to the helix coil stability are more
   complex.

   Where :

   $ \delta{}h_\mathrm{mismatch-nucleotides}$ accounts for the identity of
   the single mismatch nucleotides.

   $ \delta{}h_\mathrm{mismatch-NN interaction}$ accounts for the
   interaction between the mismatch nucleotides and the nearest neighbors.

  Tandem mismatches effect

   The tandem mismatches (two adjacent mismatches) are taken into account
   but the two first and positions cannot be mismatched. Moreover the
   thermodynamic parameters are still not available for every possible
   cases. In such a case, the program, unable to compute any relevant
   result, will quit with a warning.

   For DNA duplexes, this program computes the hybridisation enthalpy and
   entropy from the elementary parameters of each Crick's pair containing
   the mismatch(es).

           \begin{multline*} \Delta{}h_\mathrm{tandem-mismatch} =
                    \delta{}h_\mathrm{Crick's... ... \sum

   For RNA duplexes, the different models to computes the thermodynamic
   contribution of tandem mismatch to the helix coil stability are more
   complex.

  Internal loop effect

   The internal loops (more than two adjacent mismatches) are taken into
   account but the two first and positions cannot be mismatched. Moreover
   the thermodynamic parameters are still not available for every possible
   cases. In such a case, the program, unable to compute any relevant
   result, will quit with a warning. Moreover, the thermodynamics of the
   nucleic acids within the internal loop are salt independent and no salt
   correction will be applied to it. However, the thermodynamics of the
   terminal mismatches are salt dependent and a salt correction will be
   applied to them. The thermodynamic model for DNA and RNA duplexes are
   similar.

    DNA duplexes :Model from John Santalucia, Jr. and Donald Hicks, 2004

          \begin{multline*} \Delta h {(\mbox{internal-loop(n)})} =
              \delta{}h_\mathrm{asymm... ...nal-mismatch} \\ +
        \delta{}s_\mathrm{right-terminal-mismatch}\\ \end{multline*}

   Where :

   $ \delta{}h_\mathrm{internal-loop(n)}$ accounts for the internal loop
   of n nucleotides.

   $ \delta{}h_\mathrm{asymmetry}$ accounts for the internal loop
   asymmetry (when the number of nucleic acid within the internal loop is
   higher in one of the strand).

   $ \delta{}h_\mathrm{left-terminal-mismatch}$ accounts for the identity
   of the first mismatch nucleotides of the loop.

   $ \delta{}h_\mathrm{right-terminal-mismatch}$ accounts for the identity
   of the last mismatch nucleotides of the loop.

   Example : Symmetric internal loop

        \begin{multline*} \Delta H {\mbox{\texttt{G ACCG C}} \choose
     \mbox{\texttt{C CAT... ...}} + \Delta S {\mbox{\texttt{GC}} \choose

   Where :

   $ \delta{}h_\mathrm{initiation-loop(n)}$ accounts for the internal loop
   of n nucleotides.

   $ \delta{}h_\mathrm{asymmetry}$ accounts for the internal loop
   asymmetry (when the number of there is an unequal numbers of
   nucleotides on each side) with n1 and n2 the number of nucleotides on
   each strand..

   $ \delta{}h_\mathrm{per_AU/GU}$ accounts for each AU or GU base pair
   adjacent to the internal loop.

   $ \delta{}h_\mathrm{first-non-canonical-pairs}$ accounts for each

   the form 1 ×(n-1) with n > 2.

  GU wobble base pairs effect

   The wobble GU base pairs are taken into account. This pairing is a
   non-Watson-Crick base pairing between two nucleotides in RNA molecules,
   but the thermodynamic stability of a wobble base pair is comparable to
   that of a Watson-Crick base pair. Melting can also compute the
   thermodynamic of patterns with several adjacent GU base pairs. This
   program computes the hybridisation enthalpy and entropy from the
   elementary parameters of each Crick's pair containing the GU base
   pairs.

  Single dangling end effect

   The single dangling ends, that is the unmatched terminal nucleotides,
   can be taken into account, but all the thermodynamic parameters are not
   available. In such a case, the result is unpredictable, and all cases
   are possible.

   For DNA and RNA duplexes, this program computes the hybridisation
   enthalpy and entropy from the elementary parameters of the Crick's pair
   containing the single dangling end.

                    $\displaystyle \begin{array}[t]{ccc}

  Double dangling end effect

   The double dangling ends, that is the two adjacent unmatched terminal
   nucleotides, can be taken into account (mostly for RNA sequences). This
   program computes the hybridisation enthalpy and entropy in two times :
   First, it computes the energy from the single dangling end as if the
   duplex contained only a single danging end and then, it adds a bonus
   for the second dangling end if it is necessary.

  Long dangling end effect (poly A)

   The long dangling ends, that is all the adjacent unmatched terminal
   nucleotides, can be taken into account (only for polyA dangling ends
   for the moment). It is possible to compute the thermodynamic form one
   to four poly A dangling end. This program computes the hybridisation
   enthalpy and entropy from the parameters of the long dangling end with
   the adjacent terminal base pair.

  Single bulge loop effect

   The single bulge loops, that is the single unmatched internal
   nucleotides, can be taken into account. , but all the thermodynamic
   parameters are not available. In such a case, the result is
   unpredictable, and all cases are possible. There are several different
   models to compute the thermodynamic of single bulge loop:

    DNA and RNA duplexes :nearest neighbor model "NNN"

          \begin{multline*} \Delta h {(\mbox{single-bulge-loop})} =
        \delta{}h_\mathrm{unpaired-nucleotid+adjacent-base-pairs} \\
                               \end{multline*}

   Example : If the duplex is :

   GCTTAGGC
   CGA-TCCG

        \begin{multline*} \Delta H {\mbox{\texttt{GCTTAGGC}} \choose
      \mbox{\texttt{CGA-T... ... \Delta H {\mbox{\texttt{AGGC}} \choose
                   \mbox{\texttt{TCCG}}}\\ \end{multline*}

   (The same computation is performed for $ \Delta S$ )

   However, some types of single bulge loop can't be only modelled with a
   NNN nearest neighbor model and the following models can give more
   reliable and accurate results (mostly for RNA single bulge loops.)

    DNA duplexes :Model from John Santalucia, Jr. and Donald Hicks, 2004

          \begin{multline*} \Delta h {(\mbox{single-bulge-loop})} =

           \delta{}s_\mathrm{closing-AT-penalty}\\ \end{multline*}

   Where :

   $ \delta{}h_\mathrm{bulge-loop-of-1}$ accounts for the bulge loop of 1
   nucleotide.

   $ \delta{}h_\mathrm{intervening-NN}$ accounts for the intervening base
   pair stack.

   $ \delta{}h_\mathrm{closing-AT-penalty}$ accounts for each AT base pair
   adjacent to the single bulge loop.

   Example :

           \begin{multline*} \Delta H {\mbox{\texttt{GAC}} \choose
   \mbox{\texttt{C-G}}} = \... ...} + \Delta S {\mbox{\texttt{GC}} \choose

            \delta{}h_\mathrm{intervening-NN} \\ \end{multline*}

   Where :

   $ \delta{}h_\mathrm{initiation-bulge-loop-of-1}$ accounts for the
   initiation of bulge loop of 1 nucleotide.

   $ \delta{}h_\mathrm{intervening-NN}$ accounts for the intervening base
   pair stack.

   Example :

  Azobenzenes effect

   The trans azobenzenes (X_T) and cis azobenzenes (X_C) in DNA duplexes
   are taken into account. Be aware : when the number of cis azobenzenes
   increases in the sequence, the predictions are less accurate and less
   reliable.

  2-Hydroxyadenine bases effect

   The 2-hydroxyadenine bases (A*) in DNA duplexes are taken into account,
   but only in this two different sequence contexts : 5' GA*C 3' and 5'
   TA*A 3'. The program computes the enthalpy and the entropy in two times
   : first it computes the enthalpy and entropy of the two Crick's pairs
   containing the hydroxyadenine as if the base pair containing the
   hydroxyadenine was a simple AT base pair, and then it computes the
   hydroxyadenine increments.

  Locked nucleic acids effect

   The locked nucleic acids (AL, GL, CL, TL) in DNA duplexes are taken
   into account. The program computes the enthalpy and the entropy in two
   times : first it computes the enthalpy and entropy of the two Crick's
   pairs containing the locked nucleic acid as if the locked nucleic acid
   was a simple nucleic acid, and then it computes the locked nucleic acid
   increments for each Crick's base pair containing the locked nucleic

The melting temperature

   Then the melting temperature is computed by the following formula:

   Tm = $ \frac{\Delta{}H}{\Delta{}S + R \ln (C_T/F)} - 273.15 $

        Tm in K (for [Na $ ^+$ ] = 1 M)

   In case of self complementary sequences, if the sequence (5' 3') is a
   sequence of type G(CNG)xC and x > 4, the sequence mainly turns into
   hairpin loops and this program will compute the melting temperature
   with this formula :

   Tm = $ \frac{\Delta{}H}{\Delta{}S} - 273.15 $

        Tm in K

   Moreover, no ion correction will be applied to this formula.

Correction for the concentration of nucleic acid

   F is 1 in the case of self-complementarity oligonucleotides. If the
   ODNs are not self-complementary, F is 4 if both strands are present in
   equivalent amount and F is 2 if one strand is in excess (for instance
   in PCR experiments). Actually in the latter case, the formula would
   have to use the difference of concentrations rather than the total
   concentration. But if the excess is sufficient, the total concentration
   can be assumed to be identical to the concentration of the strand in
   excess. That is, if one strand is in excess, the actual formula is
   effectively $ (C_{\mbox{max}} - C_{\mbox{min}})/2$ but if $
   C_{\mbox{max}} \gg C_{\mbox{min}}$ , $ C_{\mbox{max}} - C_{\mbox{min}}$
   is close to the total concentration $ C_T$ . If $ C_{\mbox{max}}$ is
   close to $ C_{\mbox{min}}$ , $ (C_{\mbox{max}} - C_{\mbox{min}})/2$ is
   equivalent to $ C_T/4$ , which is the default correction.

   F is 4 by default but note that MELTING can detect self complementary
   sequences for perfectly matching sequences even though there is(are)
   dangling end(s). In this case, the program will automatically change F
   to 1. In addition to that, the computation takes an entropic term to
   correct for self-complementarity. In case of other self complementary
   sequences which doesn't match perfetcly, the option -self must be used
   to inform the program of the self complementarity.

Correction for the concentration of cations

   After the program computed the melting temperature for $ [$ Na $ ^+]$
   =1, an ion correction wille be applied either directly on the computed
   melting temperature or on the computed entropy. In the last case, the
   melting temperature is computed using the first formula of the Melting
   temperature section. We must enter at least one of the following ion
   concentrations : $ [$ Na $ ^+]$ , $ [$ K $ ^+]$ , $ [$ Tris $ ^+]$ or $
   [$ Mg $ ^{2+}]$ and several ion corrections are proposed (see the
   reference table to have more information):

   which is entered).

     * if $ [$ Mon $ ^+]$ = 0, a default sodium correction will be used.
     * if $ [$ Mg $ ^{2+}]$ ^0.5 / $ [$ Mon $ ^+]$ < 0.22, a default
       sodium correction is used. Monovalent ion influence is dominant,
       divalent cations can be disregarded.
     * if $ [$ Mg $ ^{2+}]$ ^0.5 / $ [$ Mon $ ^+]$ >= 0.22 and $ [$ Mg $
       ^{2+}]$ ^0.5 / $ [$ Mon $ ^+]$ < 6, a default mixed Na Mg
       correction is used. We can have a competitive DNA or RNA binding
       between monovalent and divalent cations.
     * if $ [$ Mg $ ^{2+}]$ ^0.5 / $ [$ Mon $ ^+]$ >= 6, a default
       magnesium correction is used. Divalent cation influence is
       dominant, monovalent cations can be disregarded.

   Moreover, if the user wants to use a sodium correction but also enters
   a potassium, Tris buffer and/or a magnesium concentration, a sodium
   equivalent concentration which takes into account the other ion
   concentrations is computed before applying the sodium correction.
   Several sodium equivalence ready to use are proposed by this program :

           [$ K $\displaystyle ^+]+\frac{[\mbox{Tris}^+]}{2}+3.79

Correction for the concentration of denaturing agents

   MELTING is currently accurate when the hybridisation is performed at pH
   $ 7\pm 1$ , but some temperature corrections for the formamide and DMSO
   concentrations exists and can be applied. However, these corrections
   are rough approximations and results accuracy may be lost.

Long sequences

   It is important to realise that the nearest-neighbor approach has been
   established on small oligonucleotides. Therefore the use of MELTING in
   the non-approximative mode is really accurate only for relatively short
   sequences (Although if the sequences are two short, let's say $ <$
   6 bp, the influence of extremities becomes too important and the
   reliability decreases a lot). For long sequences an approximative mode
   has been designed. This mode is launched if the sequence length is
   higher than the value given by the option -T (the default threshold is
   60 bp).

   The melting temperature can be computed by one of the following
   formulas:
     * ahs01

   $\displaystyle Tm = 80.4 + 0.345 \times \%GC + \log[$ Na $\displaystyle
         ^+] \times (17.0 - 0.135 \times \%GC) - \frac{550}{size} $
     * che93

      $\displaystyle Tm = 69.3 + 0.41 \times \%GC - \frac{650}{size} $
     * che93corr

      $\displaystyle Tm = 69.3 + 0.41 \times \%GC - \frac{535}{size} $
     * marschdot

    $\displaystyle Tm = 81.5 + 16.6 \times \log[$ Na $\displaystyle ^+] +
                    0.41 \times \%GC - \frac{675}{size} $
     * owe69

          $\displaystyle Tm = 87.16 + 0.345 \times \%GC + \log[$ Na
           $\displaystyle ^+] \times (20.17 - 0.066 \times \%GC) $
     * san98

    $\displaystyle Tm = 77.1 + 11.7 \times \log[$ Na $\displaystyle ^+] +
                    0.41 \times \%GC - \frac{528}{size} $
     * wetdna91

                         $\displaystyle Tm = 81.5 +
